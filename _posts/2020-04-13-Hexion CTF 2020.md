## Mirate

In this challenge, we will see the flag after being encrypted; when we type some words to the text box, we will receive the encrypted words corresponding with our input words.

## T&J

In this challenge we receive the pcap file, after opening the file in Wireshark, it's a USB capture pcap.

Look at the leftover captured data, it only shows 4 bytes hex strings. Therefore, I realized there is a possibility that it can be a mouse capture, and the challenge's description helped to ensure this idea more definitely.

> Can you help Tom catch Jerry?

Luckily, I did some research about USB capture (keyboard and mouse) before, so I know what action to take next. You can read [this writeup of rootusers](https://www.rootusers.com/google-ctf-2016-forensic-for2-write-up/) to know more detail.

First, I extracted USB data capture by tshark:

```console
# tshark -r jerry.pcapng -T fields -e usb.capdata > 1.txt
# tail -n 10 1.txt
0000ff000000ffff
00ff0000ffff0000
0000ff000000ffff
0000ff000000ffff
00ff0000ffff0000
00ff0000ffff0000
00ff0000ffff0000
00ff0000ffff0000
0100000000000000
0000000000000000
```
For some reasons I do not know why my data lost ```:``` so I added it

```console
# tail -n 10 2.txt 
00:00:ff:00:00:00:ff:ff
00:ff:00:00:ff:ff:00:00
00:00:ff:00:00:00:ff:ff
00:00:ff:00:00:00:ff:ff
00:ff:00:00:ff:ff:00:00
00:ff:00:00:ff:ff:00:00
00:ff:00:00:ff:ff:00:00
00:ff:00:00:ff:ff:00:00
01:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00
```
Next I change it to the coordinates

```console
# awk -F: 'function comp(v){if(v>127)v-=256;return v}{x+=comp(strtonum("0x"$2));y+=comp(strtonum("0x"$3))}$1=="01"{print x,y}' 2.txt > 3.txt
# tail -n 10 data3.txt 
1928 264
1928 265
1927 265
1927 266
1926 266
1925 266
1924 266
1923 266
1922 266
-1701 29
```

After got the coordinates, I plot it into Gnuplot.

```console
# gnuplot

```

And here is it
